# Anomaly Detection on Streamed Data üåê

Welcome to the **Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection** project! This repository dives into the fascinating world of identifying anomalies in real-time data streams using Python.

## What is Anomaly Detection?

Anomaly detection refers to the process of identifying unexpected or unusual patterns in data that deviate from the norm. These outliers can signify critical incidents, such as fraud, network intrusions, or equipment failures. By detecting these anomalies early, organizations can mitigate risks and enhance decision-making.

## Why is Anomaly Detection Important?

Anomaly detection is essential for several key reasons:

- **Proactive Risk Management**: By identifying anomalies in real-time, businesses can swiftly mitigate potential losses.  
  _Example_: A financial institution detects unusual transaction patterns indicating possible fraud, allowing them to freeze the account before significant losses occur.

- **Enhanced Security**: Detecting unusual behavior is crucial for cybersecurity, helping to prevent attacks before they escalate.  
  _Example_: A network monitoring system identifies an unusual spike in login attempts, prompting immediate action to secure user accounts and prevent a data breach.

- **Quality Control**: In manufacturing, recognizing anomalies ensures that products meet quality standards and reliability.  
  _Example_: An automated quality inspection system flags a batch of products with abnormal measurements, preventing defective items from reaching customers and safeguarding brand reputation.

- **Improved Insights**: Analyzing anomalies can reveal valuable insights that inform strategic decisions and foster innovation.  
  _Example_: A retail company analyzes shopping patterns and discovers an unexpected trend in customer preferences, leading to timely product adjustments and enhanced marketing strategies.

## How is Anomaly Detection Typically Done?

Anomaly detection can be achieved through various methods, including:

- **Statistical Techniques**: Utilizing statistical models to identify deviations based on historical data.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Employing supervised or unsupervised learning models to train on labeled datasets and identify anomalies in new data streams.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzing data collected over time to detect unusual trends or sudden shifts in behavior.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness.

In this project, I leverage Python's powerful libraries to implement these methods, showcasing effective ways to identify anomalies in streamed data.

#Anomaly: variable
#random.choices(population , weights ) choses population based on provided weight,

# The weights determine the likelihood of each item being chosen.

#anomaly = random.choices([0, random.uniform(10, 20)], [0.99, 0.01])[0] last 0 represent arrey index # population part Weight Part which is 99% normal & 1% anomaly
